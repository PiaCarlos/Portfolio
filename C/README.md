# UNIX Command Interpreter (C)

A custom terminal written in **C** that replicates basic UNIX shell functionality, supporting multitasking, memory management, and script execution.

## Features

- **Shell Commands**: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `echo`, `set`, `print`, `source`, `run`  
- **Script Execution**: Execute scripts (`source`) and background processes (`exec`)  
- **Multitasking & Scheduling**: Implements PCBs and ready queue with **FCFS**, **SJF**, **RR**, and **Aging** policies  
- **Memory Management**: Frame-based allocation, page tables, and page fault handling  
- **Variable Support**: Store and retrieve variables using `$VAR` syntax  
- **File & Directory Operations**: List files alphabetically, create directories/files, navigate directories with validation  
- **Error Handling**: Detects invalid commands, missing files, memory limits, and incorrect arguments
