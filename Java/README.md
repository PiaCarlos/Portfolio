# Java Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of Java projects!  
Each project demonstrates different aspects of algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP).  
Below you'll find summaries of my projects

---

## ðŸ”¹ McMetro: Metro System Organization Project
A simulation of a metro system applying advanced algorithms and OOP principles.  
- **Graph Representation:** Buildings as nodes, tracks as edges.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Kruskalâ€™s MST â†’ optimize track selection.  
  - Ford-Fulkerson â†’ compute max passenger flow.  
  - Greedy scheduling â†’ assign ticket checkers.  
- **Data Structures:** HashMaps, disjoint sets (union-find), Trie.  
- **Design:** Modular OOP for scalability.

## ðŸ”¹ Search Engine Project (COMP 250 Final Project)
A simplified search engine built with graphs, hash tables, and sorting algorithms.  
- **Web Crawling:** BFS-based traversal of pages & links.  
- **Data Structures:** Directed graph, hash-based word index.  
- **Ranking:** PageRank + merge sort (`fastSort`) vs bubble sort (`slowSort`).  
- **Testing:** JUnit validation of correctness & performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Block Game (Quad-Tree Board)
A puzzle game framework where players manipulate a recursive quad-tree board.  
- **Board Structure:** Recursive quad-tree of colored blocks.  
- **Features:** Reflect, rotate, smash, flatten into 2D grid.  
- **Scoring:** Perimeter goals & largest blob detection.  
- **Concepts:** Recursion + OOP game design.

## ðŸ”¹ Solitaire Cipher
A Java implementation of the **Pontifex (Solitaire) Cipher** using a custom data structure.  
- **Cryptography:** Stream cipher for encoding & decoding messages.  
- **Data Structure:** Circular doubly linked list for card deck operations.  
- **Deck Operations:** Joker moves, triple cut, count cut, keystream generation.  
- **Focus:** Efficiency in linked list manipulation.

## ðŸ”¹ Toward a Tower Defense Game
A Java-based tower defense game where bees defend their hive against advancing hornets.  
- **Game Board:** Tile objects for food, hives, nests, and paths.  
- **Insects Hierarchy:** Abstract `Insect`, `Hornet`, and specialized bees (`BusyBee`, `AngryBee`, `FireBee`).  
- **Custom Data Structure:** `SwarmOfHornets` (queue-like) to manage enemies.  
- **Mechanics:** Movement, combat, food collection, hive defense, fire damage.  
- **Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, and OOP design.
