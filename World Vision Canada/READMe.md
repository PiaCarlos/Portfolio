## Projects

### 1. Automatic Overlap Code Generator
Automatically generates overlap codes for projects to prevent double-counting beneficiaries. Handles complex overlaps, maintains data integrity, and organizes codes by country and group.

### 2. Legacy Code Translation & Optimization: Azure â†’ Snowflake
Translated a 3,000+ line legacy codebase from Azure to Snowflake. Refactored and vectorized key functions using NumPy, reducing runtime from 31 minutes to 2 minutes and improving cost efficiency.

### 3. Snowflake Stored Procedure: Daily Project Expense Table
Developed a stored procedure to consolidate project expense data into a daily-updated table. Provides month-by-month and year-to-date expense tracking for simplified reporting and analysis.
